# Get Shit Done Skills

- This is an AI conversion of the [GSD repo](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) for Claude Code as `SKILL.md` files.
    - `SKILL.md` is more widely supported.
    - Lacks less structure compared to the original repository.
    - Since this is supposedly a 1:1 conversion there's likely features that don't exist with all agents.
- This is currently untested, but was something I was interested in as skills became more popular in 2026, and I didn't have Claude Code as until recently.
- Hopefully I will have a project that I can test this on soon enough, although it seems quite heavy still, as agents and models get better at grooming some of these flows by default.
- Will this have any value? No clue [yet] 😅
